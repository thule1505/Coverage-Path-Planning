# Coverage-Path-Planning

A high-performance Python pipeline for complete coverage path planning on complex 2D maps (CAD/PNG). This project combines Boustrophedon Cellular Decomposition (BCD) for spatial partitioning and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for global route efficiency.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Safety-First BCD: Enhanced decomposition logic that splits cells at critical obstacle boundaries to prevent collisions.
- High Performance: Optimized to run maps up to 200x200 in ~5 seconds.
- Rectilinear Movement: Robot prioritizes 90-degree L-turns for professional, "human-like" cleaning patterns.
- Adaptive Snake Path: Automatically chooses horizontal or vertical zigzagging based on cell geometry.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (Submodules)
The pipeline is organized into modular stages as defined in the following files:

### 1. Pre-processing & Decomposition
- `input_processing.py`: Converts CAD/PNG images into binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGM). Includes denoising and flood-fill logic to handle closed rooms.
- `cell_decomposition.py`: Implements the BCD algorithm. It partitions the map into simple convex regions (cells) where zigzagging is safe and efficient.
*Note*: Includes a TOLERANCE parameter to handle curved walls.

### 2. Node & Graph Construction
- `node_generation.py`: Extracts geometric metadata (centroids, boundaries) and generates entry/exit candidate points for each cell.
- `reduced_graph.py`: Builds a topological map of the cells and calculates a distance matrix using A* pathfinding between cells.

### 3. Global Optimization
- `aco_mmas.py`: A **MAX-MIN Ant System (MMAS)** implementation. It solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant to find the most efficient order to visit all cells, minimizing travel time between rooms.

### 4. Detailed Path Planning
- `path_planning.py`: The "brain" of the robot's movement.
    - Generates Snake Paths (Zigzags) inside cells.
    - Ensures safe transitions between cells using A*.
    - Implements L-Turn logic for structured movement.

### 5. Orchestration
- `CoveragePipeline.py`: The master script that links all submodules. It handles the data flow from raw image input to the final master path and generates runtime metrics.

## ⚙️ Computational Pipeline

The system follows a sequential multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Map Normalization**: Raw CAD/PNG inputs are filtered and resized into an Occupancy Grid.
2. **Safety BCD**: The grid is decomposed into cells with a `TOLERANCE` check to ensure the robot never "cuts corners" into obstacles.
3. **Graph Construction**: A topological graph is built where nodes are cells and edges are the shortest A* paths between them.
4. **Global Optimization**: ACO-MMAS finds the near-optimal sequence to visit every cell, minimizing "deadheading" (unproductive travel).
5. **Coverage Generation**: Each cell is filled with a snake-path pattern, then linked into a single continuous master trajectory.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy opencv-python scikit-learn
```

### Running the Pipeline
- Place your map image (e.g., map.png) in the project root.
- Configure the CHARGING_STATION coordinates in CoveragePipeline.py.
- Execute the main script:

```bash
python CoveragePipeline.py
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & Tuning
To balance speed and safety, you can adjust these key parameters:
- Cell Safety (`cell_decomposition.py`): Set `TOLERANCE = 1` for high-sensitivity splitting (safer for complex corners) or `TOLERANCE = 3` for faster performance on curved maps.
- ACO Speed (`aco_mmas.py`): Adjust `num_ants` and `num_iiterations. For maps under 200x200, 20 ants and 100 iterations usually converge in < 2 seconds.
- Visual Aesthetics (`CoveragePipeline.py`): The visualization uses high-contrast circular badges and slate-gray paths for clarity.
